## Evidently ecosystem 

Evidently AI develop two distinct products:

* The Evidently Python library.

* The Evidently Platform.

### **Evidently Python Library**

The **Evidently Python library** allows users to run various data and AI evaluations and generate Reports and Test Suites with evaluation results. It is best suited for individual data scientists, AI, and ML engineers analyzing the quality of AI systems in a Python environment.&#x20;

The core library is open-source and available under the **Apache 2.0** license.

### Evidently Platform

The **Evidently Platform** is a web application designed for AI testing and observability. It is tailored for teams looking to collaborate on AI quality from experiments to production monitoring.

* **Open-source version**. A basic version of the platform is included in the open-source Evidently library. It has a limited feature set in favor of a very lightweight deployment.

* **Commercial edition**. Offers additional advanced features for AI quality workflows, collaboration, and scalability. Two deployment options are available:

  * **Evidently Cloud**. The recommended and easiest way to start. Evidently Cloud is hosted and managed by Evidently AI.

  * **Evidently Enterprise (Self-Hosted)**. Designed for teams with strict security requirements. This version offers a full-featured platform equivalent to Evidently Cloud that can be deployed in private clouds or on-premises.

## OSS vs. Enterprise

Commercial and open-source platforms differ in features, level of support, and maintenance costs.

| Role-based access control       | -           | +                    |
| Team collaboration features     | -           | +                    |

In summary:

* All the core evaluation features are open-source.

* The OSS version of the Evidently Platform includes the basic feature set for storing and visualizing the evaluation results. It prioritizes lightweight deployment and is suitable for smaller-scale applications.&#x20;

* The commercial version of the platform includes additional functionality related to dataset management, collaboration, no-code workflows and safety testing. It includes security features like role-based access control and comes with a scalable backend.[

### Deployment and Support

The commercial platform version includes dedicated support and onboarding.

* **Evidently OSS.** We provide documentation and a Discord community forum, but as a small team, we can’t offer extensive support to open-source users. If you’re running Evidently OSS in production, you must be comfortable troubleshooting and resolving issues on your own. If you need more hands-on support, we recommend upgrading to Evidently Cloud or getting an Enterprise license.

* **Evidently Cloud** and **Evidently Enterprise**. We offer varying tiers of support based on the selected Plan. In any scenario, you get direct access to the developers who built the platform. We provide incident response and resolution, as well as ongoing assistance on questions around feature configuration and use. For the Enterprise plan, we offer onboarding and training sessions to help establish best practices.

### Hosting and maintenance

Maintenance requirementsd depend on the setup you choose.

* **Evidently OSS**. You’re responsible for deploying and managing the platform within your environment, including backups, upgrades, and scaling. While the software is free, you need engineering resources for maintenance and cloud resources for storage and compute.

* **Evidently Cloud**. The platform is fully managed by the Evidently team, so that you can focus on building your AI products without worrying about infrastructure. This includes automatic updates, security patches, and scalability, making it the most cost-effective option. The platform is instantly available upon signup. 

* **Evidently Enterprise (Self-Hosted)**. For large organizations that need to keep data on-premises. The Enterprise version comes with dedicated implementation support, but your team must still manage ongoing configuration and maintenance.
