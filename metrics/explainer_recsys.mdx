The following metrics can be used for ranking, retrieval and recommender systems. 

**Evidently Metric**: `RecallTopKMetric`. 

Recall at K reflects the ability of the recommender or ranking system to retrieve all relevant items within the top K results. 

**Implemented method:**
* **Compute recall at K by user**. Compute the recall at K for each individual user (or query), by measuring the share of all relevant items in the dataset that appear in the top K results.

$$\text{Recall at } K = \frac{\text{Number of relevant items in } K}{\text{Total number of relevant items}}$$
