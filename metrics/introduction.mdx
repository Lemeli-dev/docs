Evaluations are a core feature of the Evidently library. 

Evidently is both an extensive catalog of 100+ ready-made evaluations, and a framework to easily implement and configure yours.

This section of the docs provides reference for all available evals and customization guides. Before exploring, make sure you're familiar with the eval workflow (check a Quickstart for [LLMs](../quickstart_llm), for [ML](../quickstart_ml)) and core concepts like `Descriptors`, `Metrics` and `Tests`.
