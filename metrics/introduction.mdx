Evaluations are a core feature of the Evidently library. It offers both a catalog of 100+ ready-made evaluations, and a framework to easily implement and configure yours.

Before exploring, make sure you are familiar with the core evaluation workflow (try an examples for [LLMs](../quickstart_llm) or [ML](../quickstart_ml)) and concepts like `Descriptors`, `Metrics` and `Tests`.
