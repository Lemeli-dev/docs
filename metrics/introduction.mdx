Evaluations are a core feature of the Evidently library. It offers both a catalog of 100+ ready-made evaluations, and a framework to implement and configure yours. 

Before exploring, make sure know the core evaluation workflow: try an example for [LLMs](../quickstart_llm) or [ML](../quickstart_ml).
