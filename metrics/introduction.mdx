Evaluations are a core feature of the Evidently library. It offers both a catalog of 100+ ready-made evaluations, and a framework to implement and configure yours. You can use Evidently to test and evaluate:

* **LLM-based applications**: summarization, Q\&A, chatbots, agents, RAGs, etc.
* **Predictive ML models**: classification, regression, ranking, recommendations.
* **Data quality** and **data drift** for text, tabular data, embeddings.

Before exploring, make sure know the core evaluation workflow: try an example for [LLMs](../quickstart_llm) or [ML](../quickstart_ml).
