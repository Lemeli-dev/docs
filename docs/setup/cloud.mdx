## 1. Create an Account

* If not yet, sign up for a [free Evidently Cloud account](https://app.evidently.cloud/signup).

* After logging in, create an **Organization** and name it.

## 2. Connect from Python

<Note>
  **When do you need an access Token?** To interact with Evidently Cloud programmatically, like to set up tracing or log results of local evals. You can also view and edit data and dashboards or run evals directly on the platform.
</Note>

### Get a Token

Click the **Key** menu icon to open the [Token page](https://app.evidently.cloud/token). Generate and save token securely.

### Install Evidently

To connect to the Evidently Cloud from Python, first [install the Evidently Python library](/docs/setup/installation).

```python
pip install evidently
```

### Connect

Import the cloud workspace and pass your API token to connect:

```python
from evidently.ui.workspace.cloud import CloudWorkspace

ws = CloudWorkspace(
token="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
url="https://app.evidently.cloud")
```

You are all set! Create a Project and run your first [evaluation](/quickstart_llm).
