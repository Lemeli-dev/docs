## 1. Create an Account

* If not yet, sign up for a [free Evidently Cloud account](https://app.evidently.cloud/signup).
* After logging in, create an **Organization** and name it.

## 2. Connect from Python

You will need an access token to interact with Evidently Cloud from your Python environment.

<Note>
  **Do I always need this?** No, you can also view and upload data, edit dashboard and run evals directly on the platform. You only need the token to interact with platform programmatically, like to set up tracing or run local evals.
</Note>

### Get a Token

Click the **Key** menu icon to open the [Token page](https://app.evidently.cloud/token). Generate and save token securely.

### Install Evidently

To connect to the Evidently Cloud from Python, first [install the Evidently Python library](/docs/setup/installation).

```python
pip install evidently
```

### Connect

Import the cloud workspace and pass your API token to connect:

```python
from evidently.ui.workspace.cloud import CloudWorkspace

ws = CloudWorkspace(
token="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
url="https://app.evidently.cloud")
```

You are all set! Create a Project and run your first [evaluation](/quickstart_llm).
