## User interface

You can create or delete a Project directly in the user interface.

* To create a Project, click on the “plus” sign on the home page, type your Project name and description.

* To change the Project name or description, hover on the existing Project, click "edit" and make the changes.

* To delete the Project, hover on the existing Project and click "delete".

<Warning>
  Deleting a Project deletes all the data inside it.
</Warning>

## Python API

To work with Projects, first [connect to Cloud Workspace](../setup/cloud) or your [local workspace](../setup/self-hosting).

### Add a Project

To create a Project inside a workspace `ws` and Organization with an `org_id`:

```
project = ws.create_project("My test project", org_id="YOUR_ORG_ID")
project.description = "My project description"
project.save()
```

In self-hosted open-source installation, you do not need to pass the Org ID. To create a Project:

```
project = ws.create_project("My test project")
project.description = "My project description"
project.save()
```

### Connect to a Project

<Tip>
  **Find the Project ID**. Once you run `create_project`, you will see the Project ID. You can also copy the Project ID from the UI: it appears above the monitoring Dashboard inside the Project.
</Tip>

To connect to an existing Project from Python, use the `get_project` method.

```python
project = ws.get_project("PROJECT_ID")
```

### Save changes

After making any changes to the Project (like editing description or adding monitoring Panels), always use the `save()` command:

```python
project.save()
```

### Browse Projects

You can see all available Projects on the monitoring homepage, or request a list programmatically. To get a list of all Projects in a workspace `ws`, use:

```python
ws.list_projects()
```

To find a specific Project by its name, use the `search_project` method:

```python
ws.search_project("project_name")
```

## \[DANGER] Delete Project

<Warning>
  Deleting a Project deletes all the data inside it.
</Warning>

To delete the Project and all the data inside it:

```
# ws.delete_project("PROJECT ID")
```

# Project parameters

Each Project has the following parameters.
