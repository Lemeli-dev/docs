Check the general evaluation flow.

You get to choose what you upload:

* **Results only (Default)**. You can upload just the evaluation outcomes as JSON snapshots. They include column summaries, metric distributions, and test results. For tabular data, this typically provides the necessary insights while keeping data private.

* **Results and Dataset**. Alternatively, you can include the dataset along with the evaluation results. This is useful for text data evaluations or whenever you want detailed row-level analysis, like investigating specific completions with low scores.

## What is snapshot?

*Whatâ€™s a snapshot?*\* This is a rich JSON version of the Report or a Test Suite with the results of an individual evaluation run that you upload to the platform.

See how to run local evals in detail:

[Generate snapshots](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/user-guide/evaluations/snapshots)

A `snapshot` is a JSON summary containing evaluation results. It captures the data and AI system performance for the specific dataset or data batch you evaluated. Snapshots can include metrics, test results, column summaries, and additional render data. You choose what to include when running your evaluation.

The snapshot functionality is based on Evidently [Reports and Test Suites](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently/blob/main/docs/book/tests-and-reports/overview.md). Put simply, a snapshot is a JSON "version" of an Evidently Report or Test Suite.

When you run individual evaluations, you can explore and compare their results. As you send multiple snapshots to a Project, you can also use a Dashboard to track results over time. This helps you monitor metric changes across experiments or track evaluations on production data.

You can optionally include the Dataset together with the evaluation results you upload.

This page walks you through how to run evaluations locally in Python and send the results to Evidently Platform. This applies both to on-the-fly evaluations during experiments and to those you run automatically during batch monitoring or regression testing.

Once you upload the evaluation results as JSON `snapshots`, you can explore, compare, and track them on the Evidently Platform.
