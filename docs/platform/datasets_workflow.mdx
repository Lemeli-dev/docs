To access or upload your Datasets in UI, navigate to the Dataset Page inside your Project.

You will be able to view all Datasets, both raw datasets you uploaded and new datasets generated as a result of an evaluation.

<Tip>
  **Tracing datasets** are in the Tracing menu section.

# User interface

To upload any existing dataset as a CSV file, click on "Add dataset".

When you upload the Dataset, you must also add a **column mapping**. This allows Evidently to understand the meaning of specific columns and prepare your Dataset for future evaluations.

# Python API

To work with Datasets programmatically from Python, you must first [connect to Workspace](../setup/cloud).

## Upload the Dataset

Prepare your dataset as a Pandas DataFrame. To upload a dataframe `df` to the specified Project in workspace `ws`, use the `add_dataset` method:

```python
ws.add_dataset(
    df,
    name = "dataset_name",
    project_id = project.id, 
    description = "Optional description")
```

You must always specify the dataset `name` you will see in the UI. The description is optional.

To get a Project ID, grab it from the existing Project page or [create a new Project first](projects_manage).

## Download the Dataset

You can also download the Dataset from Evidently platform to your local environment. For example, if you store the test dataset on the platform and want to pull it into your local evaluation script.

Use the `load_dataset` method:

```python
downloaded_df = ws.load_dataset(dataset_id = "YOUR_DATASET_ID") 
```

## Include the Dataset

You can include Datasets when you upload Reports to the platform. This way, after running an evaluation locally you simultaneously upload:
* the Report with evaluation result, and 
* the Dataset it was generated for, with added scores if applicable.

By default, you upload only the Report. 

To include the Dataset, use the `include_data` parameter:

```python
ws.add_report(project.id, data_report, include_data=True)
```

Check the docs on [generating snapshots](../library/snapshots) for details.
