The result of each evaluation is a Report (summary of metrics with visuals) with an optional Test Suite (when it also includes pass/fail results on set conditions).

**Browse the results**. To access the results of your evaluations, enter your Project and navigate to the "Reports" section in the left menu. Here, you can view all your evaluation artifacts and browse them by Tags, time, or metadata. You can also download them as HTML or JSON.

**Dashboard**. As you run multiple evaluations, you can build a Dashboard to visualize results over time.

Supported in: Supported in: `Evidently OSS`, `Evidently Cloud` and `Evidently Enterprise`.

The Dashboard aggregates data from various Reports or Test Suites within a Project, allowing you to track progress, see performance improvements, and monitor how tests perform over time.
