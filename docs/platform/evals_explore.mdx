## Evaluation results&#x20;

Supported in: Supported in: `Evidently OSS`, `Evidently Cloud` and `Evidently Enterprise`.

The result of each evaluation is either a Report (when it's just a summary of metrics) or a Test Suite (when it also includes pass/fail results on set conditions).

**Browse the results**. To access them, enter your Project and navigate to the "Reports" or "Test Suites" section in the left menu. Here, you can view all your evaluation artifacts and browse them by Tags, time, or metadata. You can also download them as HTML or JSON.

To see and compare the evaluation results, click on "Explore" next to the individual Report or Test Suite.&#x20;

**Explore view**. You'll get the Report or Test Suite and, if available, the dataset linked to the evaluation.

Supported in: `Evidently Cloud` and `Evidently Enterprise`. In Evidently OSS, you can can access only the Report.

* To view the Report only, click on the "dataset" sign at the top to hide the dataset.

* To see results from a specific evaluation within the Report, use the dropdown menu to select the Metric.

* To compare Reports side by side, click on "duplicate snapshot" (this will keep the current Metric in view), and then select a different Report for comparison.

**Dashboard**. As you run multiple evaluations, you can build a Dashboard to visualize results over time.

Supported in: Supported in: `Evidently OSS`, `Evidently Cloud` and `Evidently Enterprise`.

The Dashboard aggregates data from various Reports or Test Suites within a Project, allowing you to track progress, see performance improvements, and monitor how tests perform over time.
