<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure evaluations">
 
    To implement batch evaluations, use the basic flow of the Evidently evaluation library to compute Reports on a schedule. By configuring the Report contents, you can define which metrics to capture and optionally set test conditions.

    Check the Quickstart examples or explore the [detailed guide.](/docs/library/evaluations_overview)

      <Card title="ML quickstart" icon="table" href="/quickstart_ml">
        Test tabular data quality and data drift.
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    You will need to independently orchestrate the execution of the evaluations on a chosen cadence: consider using tools like Airflow.

  <Step title="Configure the dashboard">
    To track the results over time on a Dashboard, set it up using pre-built Tabs or configure your own choice of monitoring Panels.

    Check the [Dashboard guide](/docs/platform/dashboard_overview).&#x20;
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure alerts">
    Set up alerts on Metric values or Test failures.&#x20;
