## What is a Dashboard?

A Dashboard provides a clear view of your AI application performance, whether over time or across multiple experiments and tests.

Each Project has its own Dashboard. It's empty at first. To populate it, you need to run an evaluation and save at least one Report to the Project. You can then plot values from individual Reports over time.

## When to use Dashboard?

You can use the Dashboard to track live production quality or results from offline experiments.

The "Show in order" toggle lets you switch between two views:

* **Time Series.** Displays data with actual time intervals, ideal for live monitoring.
* **Sequential.** Shows results in equal spacing, perfect for experiments.

All Panels in a Dashboard reflect the date range set by the time range filter. You can zoom in on any time series visualization for detailed analysis.

**From Dashboard to debugging**. By clicking on any individual value on the Dashboard, you can open the associated Report and dataset to see raw examples.

## What is a Panel?

A Panel is a visual element in the Dashboard that displays specific values or test results. Panels can be counters, line plots, bar plots, etc.

You can customize your Dashboard by adding Panels:

* **Using Python API**. Define dashboard as code.
* **Through the UI**. Add Panels directly from the interface. (Cloud and Enterprise only).

To create a Panel, you need to specify:

* **Value**. You can plot both Metrics (e.g., drift score) or Test results (e.g., Pass/Fail).
* **Panel parameters** like type, size, and title.
* **Tags** (optional). You can filter and visualize specific data subsets. To enable this, you must first add Tags (e.g. a model version) to Reports when you run an evaluation.

## Using Tabs

  Multiple Tabs are available in **Evidently Cloud** and **Evidently Enterprise**.

You can organize Panels within the same Dashboard into different Tabs to logically group your views.

**Pre-built Tabs**. To simplify setup, you can start with dashboard templates for common use cases.
