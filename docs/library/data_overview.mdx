**Tabular format**. To run an evaluation, you must prepare your data in tabular format as a pandas DataFrame. All column names must be strings.

**Flexible structure**. The table can include any combination of numerical, categorical, text, metadata (including timestamps or IDs), and embeddings columns.

Here are a few examples.

  <Tab title="LLM logs">
    To evaluate generative AI quality, pass LLM outputs with optional context and ground truth. You can inlcude any number of text and metadata columns.

    | Question                             | Context                                                                                             | Answer                  |

  <Tab title="Data table">
    Pass any data table to get an exploratory data overview, run data quality and distribution drift checks. This could also be production logs of your ML model with input features and prediction column.

  <Tab title="Classification">
    To evaluate classification quality, pass a table that contains columns with predicted and actual label. Features are optional, but useful for some evals.
