**Tabular format**. To run an evaluation, you must prepare your data in tabular format as a pandas DataFrame. All column names must be strings.

**Flexible structure**. The table can include any combination of numerical, categorical, text, metadata (including timestamps or IDs), and embeddings columns.

Here are a few examples.

  <Tab title="LLM logs">
    To evaluate generative AI quality, pass LLM outputs with optional context and ground truth. You can inlcude any number of text and metadata columns.
