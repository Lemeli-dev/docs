To run evaluations, you must create a `Dataset` object with a `DataDefinition`, which maps:

* **Column types** (e.g., categorical, numerical, text, embeddings).

* **Column roles** (e.g., prediction, target, LLM output, etc.).

This help Evidently process the data correctly and treat columns appropriately when computing the Metrics. Some evaluations require certain columns, and they will fail if these are missing.

You can define the `DataDefinition` in Python before generating a Report or map the columns visually in the Evidently platform. **Automated data definition** is also available in some cases.

  You can check data requirements for specific Metrics in the [Reference table](/metrics/all_metrics).

## Basic flow

Imports:

```python
from evidently.future.datasets import Dataset
from evidently.future.datasets import DataDefinition
```

Steps to take:

* **Prepare your data.** Use a `pandas.DataFrame` (or two).

* **Create a Dataset object.** Use `Dataset.from_pandas`.

* **Pass the `data_definition`.** Ensure it includes the necessary details.

To use automated recognition, simply pass an empty `DataDefinition()`object:

```python
eval_data = Dataset.from_pandas(
    pd.DataFrame(source_df),
    data_definition=DataDefinition()
)
```

**Two datasets.** If you have two datasets (like a second reference dataset for data drift detection), you need two Dataset objects. They must identical data definition.

**Automated data definition.**  If the `DataDefinition` is not specified or set as `None`, Evidently will use the default mapping strategy, trying to match the columns:

* Based on their type (numerical or categorical),

* Based on their name if it matches a known role (for example, a target column is called "target").

**Manual data definition.** While automated definition often works, it's best to map columns manually to avoid errors. 
* Manually mapping columns avoids errors, like numerical columns with few unique values being mistaken for categorical.
* Additionally, mapping is always required for certain evals like text column or embedding column mapping for drift detection.

There are many available mapping options. However, you only need to use those that apply to your evaluation scenario. For example, you don't need role mapping to run data quality checks. If you don't map certain columns, they will be ignored.&#x20;

<Info>
  Once you have the **Dataset** ready, you can add [text Descriptors ](/docs/library/descriptors)and/or [get Reports](/docs/library/report).
</Info>

## Column types

Mapping column types helps process inputs for data quality and data drift analysis: to generate correct statistics, visualizations and types of tests.&#x20;

Example mapping:

```python
definition = DataDefinition(
    text_columns=["Latest_Review"],
    numerical_columns=["Age", "Salary"],
    categorical_columns=["Department"],
    datetime_columns=["Joining_Date"]
    )
    
eval_data = Dataset.from_pandas(
    pd.DataFrame(source_df),
    data_definition=definition
)
```

| Parameter            | Description                                                                 | Automated mapping                                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| numerical\_columns   | \* All columns with numeric types (np.number) will be treated as Numerical. | All columns with numeric types (np.number)        |
| datetime\_columns    |                                                                             | All columns with DateTime format.  (np.datetime64)  |
| categorical\_columns |                                                                             | All other columns will be treated as Categorical. |
| text\_columns        |                                                                             | N/A, require mapping                              |
| embeddings (TBC)     |                                                                             | N/A, require mapping                              |

**Embedding columns** (TBC). To specify which columns in your dataset contain embeddings (to use embeddings-specific data drift detection methods), pass a dictionary where keys are embedding names and values are lists of columns.

```python
embeddings = {'small_subset': embeddings_data.columns[:10]} #TBC
```
**Text columns**. While you don't need to map text columns to compute decscriptors, it's useful for the following analysis. This ensures relevant stats are computed for text column and they are exlcuded from Tests and Metrics where they don’t apply. If you don’t map text columns, they’ll be treated as categorical, potentially leading to irrelevant evaluations like raw text distribution histograms.

**DateTime columns.** DateTime columns will be ignored in data drift calculation and get appropriate stats and different visualizations for DateTime column in value stats.

## Column roles

### General

If you have a timestamp or ID column, it's always a good idea to map them. It serves as the index for certain plots, giving you richer visualizations in your Reports. Mapping the "Timestamp" and "ID" columns also excludes them from analyses like data drift detection, where it wouldn't add any value.


Parameter            | Description   | Automated mapping   |
| -------------------- | --------| ----------- |
| id_column | id column  |  column named "id" column" |
| timestamp  |      timestamp column (used as axis in some plots instead of index), only one column can be a timestamp       | column named "timestamp"

Difference between timestamp and datetime. Datetime is a column types, timestamp is a role. It often represents the time when a data row was recorded.Use it if you want to see it as index on the plots.  There can only be one timestamp, but many dateteim columns.  A DateTime type is any time-related column in your dataset:  for example, conversation start / end, features like "date of last contact", etc.) 


### LLM evals

description: How to define the data schema for ranking and recommendations.

To evaluate data from recommender systems, you must correctly map the input data schema. You can also pass an optional additional dataset with training data.

**Note**: this mapping will also apply to search and retrieval systems. Treat "user\_id" as "query\_id".

# Code example

Notebook example on using column mapping and additional data for recommender systems:

# Column mapping

You must define column mapping to run evaluations for recommender or ranking systems on your `current` and (optional) `reference` data. Column mapping helps point to the columns with user ID, item ID, prediction, and target.

To evaluate the quality of a ranking or a recommendation system, you must pass:

* The score or rank generated by the system as the prediction.

* The relevance labels as the target (e.g., this could be an interaction result like user click, assigned relevance label, etc.)

Here are the examples of the expected data inputs.

If the model prediction is a score (expected by default):

| user\_id | item\_id | prediction (score) | target (relevance) |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| user\_1  | item\_1  | 1.95               | 0                  |
| user\_1  | item\_2  | 0.8                | 1                  |
| user\_1  | item\_3  | 0.05               | 0                  |

If the model prediction is a rank:

| user\_id | item\_id | prediction (rank) | target (relevance) |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| user\_1  | item\_1  | 1                 | 0                  |
| user\_1  | item\_2  | 2                 | 1                  |
| user\_1  | item\_3  | 3                 | 0                  |

The **target** column with the interaction result or relevance label can contain either:

* a binary label (where `1` is a positive outcome)

* any true labels or scores (any positive values, where a higher value corresponds to a better match or a more valuable user action).

You might need to add additional details about your dataset via column mapping:

* `recommendations_type`: `score` (default) or `rank`. Helps specify whether the prediction column contains ranking or predicted score.

* `user_id`: helps specify the column that contains user IDs.

* `item_id`: helps specify the column that contains ranked items.

# Additional data

Some metrics like novelty or popularity bias require training data, which has a different structure from production data. To pass it, use the `additional_data` object. You can pass your training data as `current_train_data` and (optional) `reference_train_data`.

Example:

```python
report = Report(metrics=[
   UserBiasMetric(column_name='age'),
])
report.run(reference_data=ref, current_data=cur, column_mapping=column_mapping, additional_data={'current_train_data': train})
report
```

## Requirements:

* The additional training dataset should have the following structure:

| user | item | target |
| ---- | ---- | ------ |
| id1  | id1  | 1      |
| id2  | id9  | 1      |
| id3  | id2  | 1      |
| id3  | id1  | 1      |
| id4  | id6  | 1      |

* The names of the columns with `user_id` and `item_id` should match the corresponding columns in the current (and optional reference) data.

* The name of the column with the interaction result should match the name of the `target` column in the current (and optional reference) data.

* If you use metrics that refer to specific columns (such as `UserBiasMetric` metric), these columns must also be present in the training dataset.

* You can pass a single training dataset or two datasets (in case your reference and current dataset have different training data).

### What is the difference between training and reference data?

The reference dataset can belong to a previous production period or a different model you compare against. The training dataset is used to train the model. Their structure usually differs:

* Production data typically includes a list of all recommended items, where some of them earn a positive interaction result. It also contains negative examples (ignored recommendations) and data about model prediction (predicted rank or score).

* Training data typically contains a history of positive actions, such as user viewing history, page reads, or upvotes. Since it only includes the interaction results, it lacks negative examples (e.g., ignored recommendations) and column with the model output (predicted rank or score).

## description: How to define the data schema for classification.

To evaluate classification model performance, you must correctly map the input data schema.

# Code example

# Column Mapping

To evaluate the classification performance, you need both true labels and prediction. Depending on the classification type (e.g., binary, multi-class, probabilistic), you have different options of how to pass the predictions.

## Multiclass classification

### Option 1

Target: encoded labels, Preds: encoded labels + Optional\[target\_names].

| target | prediction |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 1      | 1          |
| 0      | 2          |
| …      | …          |
| 2      | 2          |

```python
column_mapping = ColumnMapping()

column_mapping.target = 'target'
column_mapping.prediction = 'prediction'
column_mapping.target_names = ['Setosa', 'Versicolour', 'Virginica']
```

If you pass the target names, they will appear on the visualizations.

You can also pass the target names as a dictionary:

```python
column_mapping.target_names = {'0':'Setosa', '1':'Versicolor', '2':'Virginica'}
```

or

```python
column_mapping.target_names = {0:'Setosa', 1:'Versicolor', 2:'Virginica'} 
```

### Option 2

Target: labels, Preds: labels.

| target        | prediction    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ‘Versicolour’ | ‘Versicolour’ |
| ‘Setosa’      | ‘Virginica’   |
| …             | …             |
| ‘Virginica’   | ‘Virginica’   |

```python
column_mapping = ColumnMapping()

column_mapping.target = 'target'
column_mapping.prediction = 'prediction'
```

## Multiclass probabilistic classification

Target: labels, Preds: columns named after labels.

| target      | ‘Versicolour’ | ‘Setosa’ | ‘Virginica’ |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| ‘Setosa’    | 0.98          | 0.01     | 0.01        |
| ‘Virginica’ | 0.5           | 0.2      | 0.3         |
| …           | …             |          |             |
| ‘Virginica’ | 0.2           | 0.7      | 0.1         |

```python
column_mapping = ColumnMapping()

column_mapping.target = 'target'
column_mapping.prediction = ['Setosa', 'Versicolour', 'Virginica']

```

Naming the columns after the labels is a requirement. You cannot pass a custom list.

## Binary classification

### Option 1

Target: encoded labels, Preds: encoded labels + pos\_label + Optional\[target\_names]

| target | prediction |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 1      | 1          |
| 0      | 1          |
| …      | …          |
| 1      | 0          |

By default, Evidently expects the positive class to be labeled as ‘1’. If you have a different label, specify it explicitly.

```python
column_mapping = ColumnMapping()

column_mapping.target = 'target'
column_mapping.prediction = 'prediction'
column_mapping.target_names = ['churn', 'not_churn']
column_mapping.pos_label = 0

```

If you pass the target names, they will appear on the visualizations.

### Option 2

Target: labels, Preds: labels + pos\_label

| target       | prediction   |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| ‘churn’      | ‘churn’      |
| ‘not\_churn’ | ‘churn’      |
| …            | …            |
| ‘churn’      | ‘not\_churn’ |

Passing the name of the positive class is a requirement in this case.

```python
column_mapping = ColumnMapping()

column_mapping.target = 'target'
column_mapping.prediction = 'prediction'
column_mapping.pos_label = 'churn'

```

## Binary probabilistic classification

### Option 1

Target: labels, Preds: columns named after labels + pos\_label

| target       | ‘churn’ | ‘not\_churn’ |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------ |
| ‘churn’      | 0.9     | 0.1          |
| ‘churn’      | 0.7     | 0.3          |
| …            | …       |              |
| ‘not\_churn’ | 0.5     | 0.5          |

Passing the name of the positive class is a requirement in this case.

```python
column_mapping = ColumnMapping()

column_mapping.target = 'target'
column_mapping.prediction = ['churn', 'not_churn']
column_mapping.pos_label = 'churn'

```

### Option 2

Target: labels, Preds: a column named like one of the labels + pos\_label

| target       | ‘not\_churn’ |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| ‘churn’      | 0.5          |
| ‘not\_churn’ | 0.1          |
| …            | …            |
| ‘churn’      | 0.9          |

```python
column_mapping = ColumnMapping()

column_mapping.target = 'target'
column_mapping.prediction = 'not_churn'
column_mapping.pos_label = 'churn'

```

Both naming the column after one of the labels and passing the name of the positive class are requirements.

### Option 3

Target: encoded labels, Preds: one column with any name + pos\_label

| target | prediction |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 1      | 0.5        |
| 1      | 0.1        |
| …      | …          |
| 0      | 0.9        |

```python
column_mapping = ColumnMapping()

column_mapping.target = 'target'
column_mapping.prediction = 'prediction'
column_mapping.pos_label = 1
column_mapping.target_names = ['churn', 'not_churn']

```

If you pass the target names, they will appear on the visualizations.
