The Evidently Python library is an open-source tool designed to evaluate, test and monitor the quality of AI systems, from experimentation to production.

Evidently is very modular. You can use the evaluation library on its own, or as part of the [Monitoring Platform](/docs/platform/overview) (self-hosted or Evidently Cloud). This page gives a closer look at the library.

# At a glance

Here is how the core evaluation workflow works:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pass the input data">
    Pass text, tabular or embeddings data to evaluate.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run evaluations">
    You can start with `Presets` or create a custom evaluation:

    * Compute row-level `Descriptors` for text data.

    * Use `Metrics` for dataset-level evals.

    * Optionally, add `Tests` to get pass/fail results.

    There are 100+ built-in evals. You can also add yours. Examples:

    | **Type**                  | **Example checks**                                                    |
    | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **üî° Text qualities**     | Length, sentiment, special symbols, pattern  matches, etc.            |
    | **üìù LLM outputs**        | Semantic similarity, relevance, faithfulness, custom LLM judges, etc. |
    | **üõ¢ Data quality**       | Missing values, duplicates, min-max ranges, correlations, etc.        |
    | **üìä Data drift**         | 20+ tests and distance metrics to detect distribution drift.          |
    | **üéØ Classification**     | Accuracy, precision, recall, ROC AUC, confusion matrix, bias, etc.    |
    | **üìà Regression**         | MAE, ME, RMSE, error distribution, error normality, error bias, etc.  |
    | **üóÇ Ranking (inc. RAG)** | NDCG, MAP, MRR, Hit Rate, etc.                                        |
    | **üõí Recommenders**       | Serendipity, novelty, diversity, popularity bias, etc.                |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore results">
    * **View** visual Reports directly in Python environments like Jupyter or Colab.

    * **Export** as JSON, Python dictionary, pandas DataFrame, or HTML file.

    * **Upload** to Evidently Platform to store and track over time.

    Exportability makes it easy to integrate Evidently with existing workflows and tools.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Core concepts

Below is a detailed overview of how evaluations work in Evidently. If you prefer code:

* Try a quickstart for [LLM evaluation](/quickstart_llm) or [ML evaluation](/quickstart_ml).

* Read the step-by-step [user guide](/docs/library/evaluations_overview).

That said, we recommend giving this a read to understand everything the library can do.

## Input data

First, you need to get your data ready. For example, generate outputs from your ML or LLM system that you want to evaluate.

* **Tabular data**. Prepare your data as a pandas DataFrame. All column names must be strings.

* **Flexible structure**. The table can include any combination of numerical, categorical, text, metadata (including timestamps or IDs), and embedding columns.

Here are a few examples.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="LLM logs">
    **LLM logs**. Pass any text columns with inputs/outputs, context or ground truth.

    | Question                             | Context                                                                                                   | Answer                          |
    | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
    | How old is the universe?             | The universe is believed to have originated from the Big Bang that occurred 13.8 billion years ago.       | 13.8 billion years old.         |
    | What‚Äôs the lifespan of Baobab trees? | Baobab trees can live up to 2,500 years. They are often called the ‚ÄúTree of Life‚Äù.                        | Up to 2,500 years.              |
    | What is the speed of light?          | The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (186,282 miles per second). | Close to 299,792 km per second. |
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Data table">
    **Data table**. You can pass any dataset to run run data quality and data drift checks. Use this when evaluating ML model performance without ground truth: include input features and predictions.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Classification">
    **Classification logs**. To evaluate classification quality, pass a table that contains columns with predicted and actual labels. Input features are optional but useful for some evals.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Regression">
    **Regression logs**. To evaluate regression quality, pass a table that contains columns with predicted and actual values. Input features are optional but useful for some evals.

    | Prop ID | Location      | Sq ft | Type      | Bedrooms | Has Garden | Predicted  ($) | Actual ($) |
    | ------- | ------------- | ----- | --------- | -------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------- |
    | P01     | New York, USA | 850   | Apartment | 2        | No         | 850,000        | 870,000    |

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Ranking">
    **Ranking logs**. To evaluate ranking or recommendations, pass data that contains columns with rank/score and interaction result. Features are optional but useful for some evals.

    | User ID | Movie ID | Title        | Genre         | Avg Rating | Watched (%) | Predicted Rank |
    | ------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------- | ---------- | ----------- | -------------- |

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Embeddings">
    **Embeddings**. To evaluate embeddings drift, pass embeddings as numerical columns.

    | col\_0   | col\_1   | col\_2   | col\_3   | col\_4   | ... | col\_98  | col\_99  | col\_100 |
    | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
    | 0.171242 | 0.149020 | 0.122876 | 0.121569 | 0.137255 | ... | 0.614379 | 0.613072 | 0.612000 |
    | 0.619608 | 0.628758 | 0.670588 | 0.661438 | 0.636601 | ... | 0.525490 | 0.509804 | 0.500000 |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Data Definition**. Some evaluations require specific columns or data types present. For example, to evaluate classification quality, you need both predictions and actual labels. To specify where they are located in your table, you can map the data schema using [Data Definition](/docs/library/data_definition).

**Two datasets**. Typically you run evaluations for a single dataset (`current` dataset). Optionally, you can include a second (`reference`) dataset). Both datasets must have identical structures.

![](/images/datasets_input_data_two.png)

When to use two datasets:

* **Side-by-side comparison**. This lets you compare outputs or data quality across two periods, prompt/model versions, etc.

* **Data drift detection. (Required)**. You can detect distribution shifts by comparing datasets, such as this week‚Äôs data to the previous one.

* **Simplify test setup**. You can automatically generate test conditions (e.g., min-max ranges) from the reference dataset without manual configuration.

<Info>
  **Data sampling**. Running evaluations on large datasets (millions of rows) can take time. This depends on the specific evaluation (some are more computationally intensive than others), your dataset (e.g., if you run column-level evals and have lots of columns), and your infrastructure (data is processed in-memory). If the computation takes too long, it‚Äôs often more efficient to use samples. For example, in data drift detection, you can apply random or stratified sampling.
</Info>

## Descriptors

To evaluate text data and LLM outputs, you need `Descriptors`.

A **Descriptor** is a row-level score or label that assesses a specific quality of a given text. It‚Äôs different from metrics (like accuracy or precision) that give a score for an entire dataset.

A simple example of a descriptor is `TextLength` or `Sentiment`. Descriptors range from deterministic to complex ML-based checks. For example, LLM-based descriptors can help label responses as "relevant" or "not relevant" using an evaluation prompt. Descriptors can also use two texts at once, like checking `SemanticSimilarity` between two columns.

You can use [built-in descriptors](/metrics/all_descriptors), configure templates or add custom checks in Python. Each Descriptor returns a result that can be:

* **Numerical**. Any scores like symbol count or sentiment score.

* **Categorical**. Labels or binary ‚Äútrue‚Äù/‚Äúfalse‚Äù results for pattern matches.

* **Text string**. Like explanations generated by LLM.

Evidently adds the computed descriptor values directly to the dataset.![](/images/concepts/overview_descriptors_export.png)

This helps with debugging: for example, you can sort to find the negative responses. You can export the results to a Pandas DataFrame or view on the Evidently Platform

After you get the Descriptors, you can use them to compute Metrics and Tests.

## Reports and Metrics

### What is a Metric?

A `Metric` is a key building block for evaluations at the **dataset** or **column** level. Each Metric computes a single value and has an optional visual representation (or several to choose from).

**Using Metrics with Descriptors.** After computing row-level Descriptors, you can use Metrics to aggregate the results across the dataset. For instance, you can calculate the `ValueMean` for sentiment or similarity scores. Descriptors are treated like any other column.

**Using Metrics directly.** You can also compute Metrics directly on the data you have, like a table with ML model logs. You can use Metrics both to understand your data (like column statistics) and to evaluate different aspects of AI quality (like response accuracy).

Metrics also range from simple stats to complex algorithmic evals. ([See all Metrics](/metrics/all_metrics)). Examples:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="ValueMean">
    Compute the mean value of any given column. \[ADD IMG]

    ![](/images/concepts/overview_small_preset_cat_value_example.png)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="ValueDrift">
    Compute drift score for any individual column, target or prediction. You can set drift detection methods as a parameter.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Accuracy">
    Compute classification accuracy.&#x20;
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="MissingValues">
    Compute the share of missing values in the dataset.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Diversity">
    Compute the diversity of generated recommendations.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="MeanError">
    Compute mean error for regression tasks.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### What is a Report?

A **Report** is an object you create to structure and execute evaluations.¬†You choose the Metrics to include, run the Report on your dataset, and get a clear visual summary of the results.&#x20;

* You can combine multiple individual Metrics in a Report.¬†

* You can also pass two datasets for a side-by-side comparison for each Metric.¬†

* You can include both built-in Metrics and custom Metrics in the Report.

\[ADD IMG]

![](/images/concepts/overview_small_preset_cat_value_compare_example.png)

However, in many cases, it makes sense to start with **Presets** to simplify the initial setup.

### Metric Presets

Metric Presets are pre-designed evaluation templates. They make it simple to compute multiple related Metrics at once without lengthy setup. ([See all Presets](/metrics/all_presets)).

**Small Presets**. Some Presets are ‚Äúsmall‚Äù and look like widgets with a handful of Metrics. Examples:&#x20;

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="ValueStats">
    You can view all relevant descriptive value statistics at once. The stats will be chosen based on the column or descriptor type (categorical, numerical, text).

    ![](/images/concepts/overview_small_preset_num_value_example-min.png)

    **Comprehensive Presets**. There are also large, more interactive Presets for specific scenarios that include multiple widgets. For example:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Data Drift">
        Identifies shifts in individual column distributions and consolidates the results.

        ![](/images/concepts/overview_drift_report-min.png)
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Classification">
        Breaks down classification metrics and includes debugging tools like prediction bias plots.
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="RecSys">
        Measures the performance of ranking or recommendation systems.
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Data Summary">
        Summarizes all dataset columns, generating statistics and profiles for each.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Classification">
    Multiple classification quality metrics like Precision, Recall, Accuracy, ROC AUC, etc. together.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Dataset">
    A quick overview of all dataset-level stats.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Correlations ">
    Correlations between all columns in the dataset on a heatmap.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Regression">
    Multiple regession quality metrics like MAE, ME, RMSE, etc.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can freely combine Presets and individual Metrics in a custom Report next to each other.

Reports are great for analysis and debugging. However, in many cases, you don‚Äôt want to review all the scores individually but rather confirm that nothing is off.

## Test Suites and Tests¬†

### What is a Test?

**Tests** let you validate your results against specific expectations. You create a Test by adding a **condition** parameter to a Metric.¬†Each Test will calculate a given value, check it against the rule, and report a pass/fail result.&#x20;

* You can run multiple Tests in one go.&#x20;

* You can create Tests on the dataset or column level.

* You can formulate custom conditions or use defaults.

A **Test Suite** is a collection of individual Test results. It works as an extension to a Report. Once you configure Tests, your Report will have an **additional tab** that shows a summary of outcomes.&#x20;

You can navigate the results by test status or column name.![](/images/concepts/overview_test_suite_example-min.png)

Each Test results in one of the following statuses:

* **Pass:** The condition was met.

* **Fail:** The condition wasn‚Äôt met.

* **Warning:** The condition wasn‚Äôt met, but the check is marked as non-critical.

* **Error:** Something went wrong with the Test itself, such as an execution error.

You can view extra details to debug. Examples:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Text length">
    Test that less than 5% of LLM responses fall outside the approved length.&#x20;
    ![](/images/concepts/overview_descriptor_test_example-min.png)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="LLM correctness">
    Verify that less than 10% of responses are labeled as "incorrect" by the LLM judge.&#x20;
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Recall">
    Check if recall stays within ¬±10% of a reference model.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Value stability">
    Test that the mean value of a column is within ¬±2 of its standard deviation.¬†
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Dataset drift">
    Test that no more than 50% of features show drift. (Dataset-level Test)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Test Conditions

Evidently has a powerful API to [set up Test conditions](/docs/library/tests).&#x20;

* **Manual setup.** You can add thresholds to Metrics one by one, using simple syntax like **greater than (`gt`)** or **less than (`lt`)**.¬†By picking different Metrics to test against, you can formulate fine-grained conditions like "less than 10% of texts can fall outside 10‚Äì100 character length."

* **Manual setup with reference.** If you have a reference dataset (like a previous data batch), you can set conditions **relative** to it. For example, you can check if the min-max value range stays within ¬±5% of the reference range without setting exact thresholds.

* **Automatic setup.** You can run any Test using built-in defaults. These are either:

  * **Heuristics**. For example, the Test on missing values assumes none should be preset.

  * **Heuristics relative to reference.** Here, conditions adjust to a reference. For instance, the Test on missing values assumes their share should stay within ¬±10% of the reference.

### Test Presets

For even faster setup, there are **Test Presets**. Each Metric Preset has a corresponding Test Preset that you can enable as an add-on.¬†When you do this:

* Evidently adds a predefined set of Tests to your Report.

* These Tests use default conditions, either static or inferred from the reference dataset.

For example:¬†

* **Data Summary**. The Metric Preset gives an overview and stats for all columns. The Test Suite checks for quality issues like missing values, duplicates, etc. across all values.

* **Classification.** The Metric Preset shows quality metrics like precision or recall. The Test Suite verifies these metrics against a baseline, like a dummy baseline calculated by Evidently or previous model performance.

## Building your workflow

You can use Evidently Reports and Test Suites on their own or as part of a monitoring system.¬†

### Independent use

Reports are great for exploratory evals:

* **Ad hoc evals.** Run one-time analyses on your data, models or LLM outputs.

* **Experiments.** Compare models, prompts, or datasets side by side.

* **Debugging.** Investigate data or model issues.

Test Suites are great for automated checks like:

* **Data validation.** Test inputs and outputs in prediction pipelines.¬†

* **CI/CD and regression testing.** Check AI system performance after updates.

* **Safety testing**. Run structured behavioral tests like adversarial testing.¬†

For automation, you can integrate Evidently with tools like Airflow. You can trigger actions based on Test results, such as sending alerts or halting a pipeline.

### As part of platform

You can use **Reports** together with the **Evidently Platform** in production workflows:

* **Reports** serve as a metric computation layer, running evaluations on your data.

* The **Platform** lets you store, compare, track and alert on evaluation results.

Reports are stored as JSON files, which can be natively parsed to visualize metrics on a Dashboard.

![](/images/evals_flow_python.png)

This setup works for both experiments and production monitoring. For example:

* **Experiments.** Log evaluations while experimenting with prompts or model versions. Use the Platform to compare runs and track progress.

* **Regression Tests.** Use Test Suites to validate updates on your golden dataset. Debug failures and maintain a history of results on the Platform.

* **Batch Monitoring.** Integrate Reports into your data pipelines to compute Metrics for data batches. Use the Platform for performance tracking and alerting.

**Evidently Cloud** also offers managed evaluations to generate Reports directly on the platform, and other features such as synthetic data and test generation.

**Platform deployment options.** You can choose:

* Self-host the open-source platform version.¬†

* Sign up for [Evidently Cloud](https://www.evidentlyai.com/register) (Recommended).¬†
