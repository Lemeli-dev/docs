You can view or export evaluation results in multiple formats.

## Reports

### Log to Workspace

You can save the Report in Evidently Cloud or your local workspace.

```python
ws.add_report(project.id, my_eval, include_data=False)
```

<Info>
  **Uploading evals**. Check Quickstart examples [for ML](/quickstart_ml) or [for LLM](/quickstart_llm) for a full workflow.

### View in Jupyter notebook

You can directly render the visual summary of evaluation results in interactive Python environments like Jupyter notebook or Colab.

After running the Report, simply call the resulting Python object:

```python
my_report
```

This will render the HTML object directly in the notebook cell.

### HTML

You can also save this interactive visual Report as an HTML file to open in a browser:

```python
my_report.save_html(“file.html”)
```

This option is useful for sharing Reports with others or if you're working in a Python environment that doesn’t display interactive visuals.

### JSON

You can get the results of the calculation as a JSON. It is useful for storing and exporting results elsewhere.

To view the JSON in Python:

```python
my_report.json()
```

To save the JSON as a separate file:

```python
my_report.save_json("file.json")
```

### Python dictionary

You can get the output as a Python dictionary. This format is convenient for automated evaluations in data or ML pipelines, allowing you to transform the output or extract specific values.

To get the dictionary:

```python
my_report.dict()
```

### Dataframe (TBC)

You can get the Report results in a tabular format as a DataFrame.

To export results for a specific Metric:

```
my_report.as_dataframe("DatasetStats")
```

To export results for the entire Report, which returns a dictionary of DataFrames:

```
my_report.as_dataframe()
```

This will return all relevant values that are computed inside the Metric as the metric result.

### Evidently snapshot (TBC)

You can also save the output of a Report as an Evidently JSON `snapshot`.

<Info>
  **How is a JSON snapshot different from `json()`?** Standard JSON output contains only the metric and test results. The JSON snapshot contains all supplementary and render data. This lets you restore the output in any Evidently format (like HTML) without accessing the initial raw data.
</Info>

When you save Reports to the platform using `add_report`, a snapshot is generated automatically. However, you can also generate and save a snapshot explicitly.

To save the Report as a snapshot:

```python
drift_report.save('snapshot.json')
```

To load the snapshot back, use the “load” function.

```
loaded_report = Report.load('snapshot.json')
```

After you load the snapshot back, you can again view it in Python or export it to other formats.

## Descriptors

If you generated text Descriptors during your evaluation, you can also publish the DataFrame with all generated descriptors added to each row of your original input data.

This export will work for the Dataset object:

```python
eval_dataset.as_dataframe()
```

This returns the complete original dataset with new scores.

<Note>
  **Getting descriptors**. Check the [complete guide](/docs/library/descriptors).
